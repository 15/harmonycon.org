Now that I'm able to travel - and since I launched my pony podcast Friendship is Content last year with my best friend - visiting cons have been a consistent source of joy to me. I truly love meeting fellow fans of the things we love, and being able to share my artwork with others is the cherry on top of an experience that already means the world to me!

I make stickers, prints, pinback buttons, enamel pins, acrylic standees, keychains, premade badges, magnets, and more! I've also recently dipped into the world of machine embroidery with handmade plushies and patches. Most of my clients have me make their ocs / sonas, but I am working on adding premade plushies to my convention lineup as well.`,
