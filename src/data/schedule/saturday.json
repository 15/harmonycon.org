    "description": "Come one, come all as we dive deeply into ObabScribbler's \"Friendship is Tragic 2: A Tale of Two Princesses\". While just like any MLP fanfic, it features our favorite techni-colored equines, it is important to be prepared as well. This emotional rollercoaster goes into themes of the complexities of relationships, love, and, of course, tragedy. We, the cast (including our creatively driven boss) of FiT2, will analyze the voice acting, character arcs, and all the emotional beats this tale presents. In addition, we will look at how the themes of friendship and tragedy resonate with listeners. Whether you are a longtime fan of ObabScribbler or new to the series, this story will surely make your heart skip a beat. Finally, there will be a chance to ask questions. Do not miss this opportunity to connect and reflect on one of the most powerful audio dramas the Brony fandom has offered in recent years!"

But there's evidence of an episode of Hello Pinkie Pie that never aired: a one-second clip shown during a montage at a Hasbro investor presentation. This panel will explain and explore what is known about this lost little piece of MLP media."
